This Project is a sample app demonstrating the use of the most used [Dagger2 dependency injection](https://github.com/google/dagger)

- Constructor Injection @Inject
- Dagger Component create
- Field Injection
- Method Injection
- Module Injection @Module using provide @Provides
- Binding implementation to interface using @Binds
- Inject data at run time using @Component.Builder @BindInstance and @Named to show the difference between variables.
